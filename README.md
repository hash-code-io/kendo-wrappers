# Simple, opinionated Wrappers for Kendo UI's Angular components

This library is focused on providing a simplified and streamlined experience for [Kendo Angular UI components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui).
Kendo UI components are powerful, but sometimes you don't need all that power. 
You want simple abstractions focused on providing a narrow API, or you want automatic translations using [Transloco](https://ngneat.github.io/transloco/), etc.
That is what this library is for.
